CausallyLinked
==============

This plugin is a quick demonstration of the Causally Linked pattern
that I talked about at:

http://www.cinnamond.me.uk/articles/The-Causal-Links-Pattern

The code is hastily written and a bit nasty, but it is enough to
demonstrate the pattern. As I rewrite it I'll keep this repo up to
date.

After installing the plugin, you need to copy the two migrations into
your migrations directory and run them. This creates two tables -- one
to store the available relationships and another to store the links
between objects.
